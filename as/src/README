# AS code for different ANE platforms.

This is a mirror of the GKSession and GKPeerPickerController classes in iOS

The "default" platform classes contain enums and event classes plus stub code for the
GKSession/GKPeerPickerController/GKPeerToPeer classes which would normally perform the core native extension
communication logic.

The iOS platform contains the actual implementation of the GKSession/GKPeerPickerController/GKPeerToPeer classes.

They are linked together at comile time with the ANT script found in /build.
